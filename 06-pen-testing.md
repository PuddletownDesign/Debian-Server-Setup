# Pen Testing Debian on Kali

## Configuring Kali

We need to make Kali be able to speak with the debian vm over the local connection.

1.  Taking a snapshot on debian know the state that you started with. Always. This way you can go back and trace specific changes from clean to compromised.
2.  Searching for specific attacks against wide spread software.
3.  Emabling semi secured servies you think you can exploit
4.  Research strange computer science concepts and find unfortunate consequences at a low level.
5.  Bug bounties don't pay for known bugs, so find specifically interesting lines of research and follow them.
